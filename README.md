## Description

Built from python, Celeratas uses a custom ident-oriented syntax that features latin keywords. Although some of the text is written in latin, there is an English help menu with translations for all of the keywords.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

-   Windows, Macos, Unix, or Linux
-   Python3

### Installing

-   Open the terminal and type:

```
pip3 install Celeratas
```

### Executing program

-   In order to open the Celeratas interactive shell, type the following into the terminal:

```
celer
```

-   From there, you can type 'auxilium' (meaning help) to learn about the basics of the language.

```
auxilium
```

-   If you want to read from a file instead, add the file name as an argument.

```
celer file_you_want_to_read.clr
```
